<p>A chicken sandwich is only as good as its ingredients. That's why we import our spices and use top-quality ingredients in each of our Nashville Hot Chicken tenders, as well as our other offerings.
We pride ourselves in following the traditional Hot Chicken seasonings and processes used in Nashville, the birthplace of Hot Chicken. From dry spice to the classic hot oil, our Hot Chicken is as Nashvillian as it gets!.
Why It's Effective.Baba's is a Nashville hot chicken chain that operates across California. In nearly every sentence, the headline and description on its homepage stress that it is authentic Nashville hot chicken â€” not some cheap West Coast imitation. When your restaurant has a well-defined value prop like this, the description is no place for subtlety; you want to hammer it clearly, concisely and continuously. Baba's does this with text and then validates it with loud, in-your-face, food photography.
